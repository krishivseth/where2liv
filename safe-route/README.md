# safe-route

safe-route is a route planning application that helps users find the safest walking routes by considering crime data and providing alternative paths. The application uses real-time crime data and advanced routing algorithms to suggest routes that minimize exposure to high-crime areas.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Visualize routes and crime density with a Leaflet-based map.
- **Crime Heatmap:** Overlay real-time crime data on the map to identify high-crime areas.
- **Smart Route Planning:** Get optimized routes based on your preferred mode and safety considerations.
- **Multiple Transportation Modes:** Plan routes for walking, cycling, and driving.
- **Route Options:** Choose between the Fastest (shortest distance) and Safest (crime avoidance) routes.
- **Real-time Crime Data:** Integrates with NYC Open Data for up-to-date crime statistics.
- **Location Search:** Easily find start and end points using a search bar with auto-suggestions.
- **Route History:** Save and load previous route searches using local storage.
- **Estimated Travel Time & Distance:** Get clear information about your planned journey.
- **Responsive UI:** The application adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless mobile and desktop experience.
- **Custom Markers:** Distinct visual markers for start and end locations.
- **AI Route Assistant:** Get real-time guidance and safety recommendations from an AI assistant while planning your route.
