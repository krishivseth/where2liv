## API Requirements

The frontend expects the backend safety API to be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5002` with the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/safety` - Main safety analysis endpoint
- `GET /api/safety/borough-comparison` - Borough comparison data

Ensure the backend `safety_analyzer.py` and updated `app.py` are running before testing the extension.
